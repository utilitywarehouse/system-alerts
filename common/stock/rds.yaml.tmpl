            Low freeable memory means that there is a spike in database connections or that your instance may be under high memory pressure. 
            Check for memory pressure by monitoring the SwapUsage in addition to FreeableMemory. 
            If the instance memory consumption is frequently too high, this indicates that you should check your workload or upgrade your instance class.
            NOTE: `db.t4g.micro` is constantly under memory pressure, so it's usable only for testing that your connection setup works, but it's not suitable for dev usage.
            Consider upgrade at least to `db.t4g.small`.

            CPU utilization measures non-idle time.
            Consider using Enhanced Monitoring or Performance Insights to review which wait time is consuming the most of the CPU time (guest, irq, wait, nice, and so on). 
            Then evaluate which queries consume the highest amount of CPU. 
            If you can't tune your workload, consider moving to a larger DB instance class.
